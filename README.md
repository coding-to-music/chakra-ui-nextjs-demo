How to Use Chakra UI with Next.js and React

Building websites and applications is hard. There are a lot of things to consider to make sure our apps are usable and accessible including how our React components work.

How can we take advantage of the power of Chakra UI to build great web apps?

- What is Chakra UI?
- What makes Chakra UI so great?
- What are we going to build?
- Step 0: Creating a new React project with Next.js
- Step 1: Installing and configuring Chakra UI in Next.js
- Step 2: Adding Chakra UI components to a React app
- Step 3: Making responsive components with Chakra UI
- Step 4: Customizing the default Chakra UI theme

## What is Chakra UI?

Chakra UI is a component library for React that makes it easy to build the UI of an app or website.

Their goal is to provide a simple, modular, and accessible set of components to get up and running quickly.

## What makes Chakra UI so great?

To start, by default Chakra strives to make each component accessible. It‚Äôs a critical part of application development that‚Äôs often overlooked, and the Chakra maintainers have gone out of their way to ensure the components follow the WAI-ARIA guidelines.

Chakra also includes a simple API allowing developers to get productive. It allows people and teams to make inclusive apps without having to worry about building a bunch of components themselves.

For styling and customization, Chakra uses Emotion under the hood to provide developers the ability to style their components right inside of their JavaScript with style props. It comes with a default theme, but allows the ability to easily override it with custom settings.

## What are we going to build?

To get a good idea of how Chakra works, we‚Äôre going to essentially rebuild the default Next.js template with Chakra UI components.

This will help us understand a few important concepts, such as how to use Chakra UI with Next.js, how to add custom styles with props, and how to customize the Chakra UI theme.

The concepts here can apply pretty much to any React app, though the examples will be slightly specific to Next.js.

## Step 0: Creating a new React project with Next.js

To get started, we need a React app. We‚Äôre going to use Next.js as our framework which will give us the ability to easily spin up a new app.

Once inside the directory you want to create your project in, run:

```java
yarn create next-app my-chakra-app
# or
npx create-next-app my-chakra-app
```

Note: feel free to change my-chakra-app to whatever you want to name the project directory.

And once that‚Äôs finished, you can navigate into that directory and start the project with:

```java
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

That should spin up your development server at http://localhost:3000 and we should be ready to go!

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/nextjs-default-template.jpg" alt="Image" />
  <p>Default Next.js template</p>
</div>

Follow along with the commit!

## Step 1: Installing and configuring Chakra UI in Next.js

Next, let‚Äôs install Chakra UI.

Inside of your project directory, run:

```java
yarn add @chakra-ui/core @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
# or
npm install @chakra-ui/core @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
```

This will install Chakra UI and its dependencies, which includes Emotion, as it relies on it for the styling.

To get Chakra working inside of our app, we need to configure a Provider at the root of our application. This will allow all of Chakra‚Äôs components to talk to each other and use the configuration to maintain consistent styles.

Inside `pages/_app.js`, first let‚Äôs import our Provider at the top:

```java
import { ThemeProvider, theme } from '@chakra-ui/core';
```

Next, replace the return statement inside of the component with:

```java
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

As you‚Äôll notice, we‚Äôre also passing a theme variable to our provider. We‚Äôre importing the Chakra UI default theme straight from Chakra and passing it in to our ThemeProvider so all of our components can get the default styles and configurations.

Finally, we want to add a component called CSSReset right as a direct child of our ThemeProvider.

First, add CSSReset as an import:

```java
import { ThemeProvider, theme, CSSReset } from '@chakra-ui/core';
```

Then add the component right inside ThemeProvider:

```java
<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <CSSReset />
  <Component {...pageProps} />
</ThemeProvider>
```

And now if we reload the page, we can see that things are looking a little bit different!

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/nextjs-chakra-ui-css-reset.jpg" alt="Image" />
  <p>Next.js with Chakra UI CSS Reset</p>
</div>

The browser comes with a lot of default styles and by default, Chakra UI doesn‚Äôt override them. This includes styles like borders on a button element.

While we don‚Äôt necessarily need the CSS Reset here, we could override those things manually. This provides us with a foundation where we‚Äôll know that Chakra UI is working as it‚Äôs intended to and we can start adding our components.

## Step 2: Adding Chakra UI components to a React app

Now for the fun part. We‚Äôre going to use Chakra UI components to try to rebuild the Next.js default template. It‚Äôs not going to look 100% exactly like it, but it will carry the spirit and we can customize it as we‚Äôd like.

### Building the Title and Description

Starting from the top, let‚Äôs update our title and description.

At the top of the page, we need to import our Heading component:

```java
import { Heading, Link } from "@chakra-ui/core";
```

Then let‚Äôs replace the `<h1>` with:

```java
<Heading as="h1" size="2xl" mb="2">
  Welcome to Next.js!
</Heading>
```

Here, we‚Äôre using the `Heading` component which we then set ‚Äúas‚Äù an h1. We can use any HTML heading element tag name, but since we‚Äôre replacing an `h1`, we want to use that.

We‚Äôre also setting a size attribute, which allows us to control how big out heading is, as well as `mb`, which stands for `margin-bottom`, allowing us to add some space below.

And we can already see our page is looking more like the default template.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/chakra-ui-heading-component.jpg" alt="Image" />
  <p>Chakra UI Heading component</p>
</div>

We also want to add back our link.

Add `Link` to our import statement at the top and then inside of our <Heading> component, replace the Next.js text with:

```java
<Link color="teal.500" href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js!</Link>
```

Chakra‚Äôs Link component creates a link as expected, but then allows us to use the style props to customize it. Here, we‚Äôre using the color variable teal.500 that Chakra provides to change our link to Chakra‚Äôs colors.

And we can see that we have our Next.js link!

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/chakra-ui-heading-with-link.jpg" alt="Image" />
  <p>Chakra UI Heading with Link component</p>
</div>

The last piece of the header is the description. For that, we want to use the Text component.

Add Text and Code to the import statement and replace the description with:

```java
<Text fontSize="xl" mt="2">
  Get started by editing <Code>pages/index.js</Code>
</Text>
```

We‚Äôre using the Text component to recreate a `<p>` tag and the Code component to create our `<code>` tag. Similar to our Heading component, we‚Äôre adding a fontSize to make the font bigger and mt which stands for margin-top to add some space above it.

And now we have our header!

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/chakra-ui-text-with-code-component.jpg" alt="Image" />
  <p>Chakra UI Text component with Code</p>
</div>

### Replacing info cards with Chakra UI components

For each of our cards, we can use the same concepts as we did with the header to recreate each of our boxes.

To start, add an import for the Flex component and replace the tag <div className={styles.grid}> with:

```java
<Flex flexWrap="wrap" alignItems="center" justifyContent="center" maxW="800px" mt="10">
  ...
</Flex>
```

Make sure to leave all of the cards inside of the Flex component. The Flex component will recreate our grid by adding Flexbox along with the same properties that were on the grid before.

At this point, it should exactly the same as it did before.

Next, add Box to the import statement and then replace the first card with:

```java
<Box as="a" href="https://nextjs.org/docs" p="6" m="4" borderWidth="1px" rounded="lg" flexBasis="45%">
  <Heading as="h3" size="lg" mb="2">Documentation &rarr;</Heading>
  <Text fontSize="lg">Find in-depth information about Next.js features and API.</Text>
</Box>
```

Similar to our Heading component, we‚Äôre setting our Box component ‚Äúas‚Äù an <a> tag allowing it to serve as a link. We then configure our style props to replicate our cards.

Inside of that, we use the Heading and Text component to recreate the actual content of the cards.

And after only changing the first card, we can now see the changes:

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/chakra-ui-box-component.jpg" alt="Image" />
  <p>Chakra UI Box component</p>
</div>

Now, we can go back and replace the other three cards with the same components to finish recreating our grid.

For fun, we can add a 5th card that links to Chakra UI:

```java
<Box as="a" href="https://chakra-ui.com/" p="6" m="4" borderWidth="1px" rounded="lg" flexBasis="45%">
  <Heading as="h3" size="lg" mb="2">Chakra UI &rarr;</Heading>
  <Text fontSize="lg">Build accessible React apps & websites with speed.</Text>
</Box>
```

And with all of our changes, we can now see our recreated Next.js starting template!

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/chakra-ui-nextjs-grid.jpg" alt="Image" />
  <p>Chakra UI recreating Next.js grid</p>
</div>

Follow along with the commit!

## Step 3: Making responsive components with Chakra UI

Part of what the default Next.js grid was able to provide was the ability for the cards to expand to full width once the size of the browser becomes small enough. This is particularly relevant at 600px, which typically means someone‚Äôs on a mobile device.

If we look at our page on a mobile device, we can see that our cards aren‚Äôt filling up the entire width.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/chakra-ui-not-responsive.jpg" alt="Image" />
  <p>Chakra UI default without responsive</p>
</div>

Chakra allows us to set responsive styles with its baked in sizing, allowing us to easily recreate our responsive grid cards.

To do this, instead of passing in a single value to our style props, we can pass in an array.

For instance, on each of our Box components, let‚Äôs update the flexBasis prop to:

```java
flexBasis={['auto', '45%']}
```

Here, according to Chakra‚Äôs default responsive breakpoints , we‚Äôre saying that by default, we want our flexBasis to be set as auto. But for anything 480px and larger, again which is Chakra‚Äôs default first breakpoint, we set it to 45%.

Chakra considers its responsive styling to be mobile first, which is why you see the 480px act as a minimum size, not a maximum size.

And with that change, we can now see that on a large device, we still have our grid.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/chakra-ui-large-device.jpg" alt="Image" />
  <p>Chakra UI components on large device</p>
</div>

But now on mobile, our cards take up the entire width!

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/chakra-ui-small-device.jpg" alt="Image" />
  <p>Chakra UI components on small device</p>
</div>

Using the array pattern works for all of the breakpoints, so if you wanted more control over your styles, Chakra lets you do that.

## Step 4: Customizing the default Chakra UI theme

While Chakra provides a pretty great default theme, we also have the ability to customize it to our liking to match our brand or personal taste.

For instance, while the teal that we used for our Heading link is great and uses Chakra‚Äôs styles, what if I wanted to customize all links to use the purple that I use on my website?

To start, Chakra comes with a default purple, so we can update our link to use that purple:

```java
Welcome to <Link color="purple.500" href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js!</Link>
```

And we see our change.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/nextjs-purple-header.jpg" alt="Image" />
  <p>Making Next.js header link purple with color style prop</p>
</div>

That looks great, but let‚Äôs update it to the exact purple I use.

Inside of pages/\_app.js, we‚Äôre going to create a new object at the top of the page, where we spread the default theme creating a new theme object. We‚Äôll also replace the theme prop with our new object:

```java
const customTheme = {
  ...theme
}
```

```java
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
return (
<ThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>
```

If we save and reload the page, it will look exactly the same.

Next, we want to update the colors, so in our custom theme object, let‚Äôs add the colors property, where we can then set our custom purple:

```java
const customTheme = {
  ...theme,
  colors: {
    ...theme.colors,
    purple: '#692ba8'
  }
}
```

Note: you‚Äôll see here that we‚Äôre also spreading theme.colors. If we don‚Äôt, we‚Äôll be replacing the colors object with only the purple value, meaning we won‚Äôt have any other colors.

But if we reload the page, our link isn‚Äôt purple anymore!

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/nextjs-link-no-color.jpg" alt="Image" />
  <p>Next.js link with no color</p>
</div>

Chakra typically uses ranges of colors which allows us to use different shades of each of the colors. In our Link component, we‚Äôre specifying purple.500 which we didn‚Äôt set to exist.

So to fix that, we can use a tool like Smart Swatch to get all of our color values that we need and set those in our custom theme object:

```java
const customTheme = {
  ...theme,
  colors: {
    ...theme.colors,
    purple: {
      50: '#f5e9ff',
      100: '#dac1f3',
      200: '#c098e7',
      300: '#a571dc',
      400: '#8c48d0',
      500: '#722fb7',
      600: '#59238f',
      700: '#3f1968',
      800: '#260f40',
      900: '#10031a',
    }
  }
}
```

Tip: Smart Swatch actually lets you copy those values as a JavaScript object, making it easier to paste into our theme!

And now if we reload the page, we can see our purple!

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/nextjs-custom-purple.jpg" alt="Image" />
  <p>Next.js with custom purple</p>
</div>

While we used a range value here, we can also specify color variables without a range.

Say I wanted to leave the default Chakra purple ‚Äúas is‚Äù but provide a way for me to reference my purple.

To do that, I could remove those purple values and add a new custom variable:

```java
const customTheme = {
  ...theme,
  colors: {
    ...theme.colors,
    spacejelly: '#692ba8'
  }
}
```

Then update my Link to use that color:

Welcome to <Link color="spacejelly" href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js!</Link>
And we can see that we‚Äôre now using our purple without overriding the original:

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/nextjs-spacejelly-purple.jpg" alt="Image" />
  <p>Next.js with custom color variable</p>
</div>

We can apply this to most parts of the styles of Chakra, including Typography and setting custom Breakpoints. It‚Äôs another way to make our project custom to our own while still taking advantage of the power of Chakra!

### What else can you do with Chakra UI?

While we went through some simpler examples, it really opens the door to more complex style changes and controls that Chakra provides with its component APIs.

There are also a whole lot of awesome components that you can use to transform your website or application and make development fast and easy!

They even provide recipes that have some examples of how you can combine the components resulting in powerful functionality. This includes a responsive header and even adding animations with Framer Motion.
